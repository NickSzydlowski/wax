excerpt: From writing a manifesto at 16 that included “My mission is to destroy hatred
  and prejudice” to remaining active into her 80s, Betita modeled lifelong commitment
  to peoples’ global movements for liberation. She showed us how to be a scholar-organizer;
  how to mentor with love and rigor, never ceasing to grow your own politics and understanding;
  and how to dedicate your life to struggle while also cultivating joy and hilarity.
