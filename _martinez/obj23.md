excerpt: No matter what city or town or part of the country Betita lived in, she made
  special contributions and created life-long memories. One of her greatest assets
  was her ability to inspire and mentor young people. Here in New Mexico she passed
  on her knowledge and skills to scores of <em>jovenes</em> in the Movimiento Chicano.
