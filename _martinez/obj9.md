excerpt: 'Elizabeth ''Betita'' Sutherland Martínez spent her life fighting the death
  and destruction imposed by the White House and the Pentagon, from border jails to
  police barracks in every city and town across the United States. She used her powers
  as a gifted translator, editor, author, and organizer in opposition to racism and
  the brutality of empire building, and in agitation for an alternative society. '
