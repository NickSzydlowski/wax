excerpt: 'In New Mexico, Martínez shaped a generation of activists. As co-founder
  of El Grito del Norte, she brought her expertise in writing, editing and publishing
  to create a radical publication during the height of the Chicano Movement, from
  1968-73. During those five years, Martínez worked closely with young activists who
  would later go on to become leaders and experts in their own right. '
