excerpt: We stand on the shoulders of giants. Elizabeth “Betita” Martínez was a giant
  if ever there was one. In the Mexican tradition we say the name of the deceased
  and then proclaim Que Viva! This tradition heralds that the imprint of our ancestor
  lives on in our memories and in our deeds. In this way, the spirit of our ancestor
  lives—Que viva Betita!
