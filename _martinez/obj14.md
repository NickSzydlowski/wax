excerpt: 'Martínez’s output was remarkable — seven nonfiction books and countless
  articles — all while working for any number of socialist, anti-war and anti-racism
  causes. She wrote film reviews, translated a novel from French to English, and even
  fit in a run for governor on the Peace and Freedom ticket in 1982. '
